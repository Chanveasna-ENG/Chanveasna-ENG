- 👋 Hi, I’m Veasna
- 👀 I’m interested in Low-Level Programming, Embedded devices and Reverse Engineering.
- 🙄 I don't like Web Technology. I think it is so bloated. Maybe I don't have the skills to manage the complicated tech stack of the web.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ then potentially reverse engineering. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on low-level software like driver or other embedded devices that will allow me to practice my C/C++ further.
- 📫 How to reach me: 2023448eng@aupp.edu.kh
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't care about pronouns, but I am a MAN.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The first programming language I learned was JAVA, and I hated it.
